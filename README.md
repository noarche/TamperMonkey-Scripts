# TamperMonkey-Scripts

Scrape image links and save as a text file. 

Load with TamperMonkey extension. 

Filter links by string to parse/save.

Save page as 1 html file. Including images.  Unlike the others this script is kinda buggy, I recommend using [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) extension to do this.
